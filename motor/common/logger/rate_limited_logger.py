"""Rate-limited logger helpers (log-quality standard §6 anti-spam).

Two complementary mechanisms:

1. ``error_window`` — collapses repeated identical errors inside a time window
   into a single ``count=N`` line. Use for transient failures (network, RPC)
   that are expected to retry.

2. ``emit_periodic`` — emits a periodic summary line ("succeeded N times in
   last 60s") for high-frequency success paths that would otherwise flood
   logs. Use alongside a per-call DEBUG line.  Emit level is configurable;
   most periodic probes use ``level="DEBUG"`` to reduce noise, while key
   health probes (e.g. coordinator readiness) remain at INFO.

The helpers are **stateless across instances** — each RateLimitedLogger owns
its own counters and timers. A single RateLimitedLogger should be shared by
all callers within one process (e.g. one per API client class).
