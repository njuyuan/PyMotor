"""Shared helpers for PD/CDP rescheduler (token-cache retry and request rewrite).

Performance note: per-chunk JSON re-serialization is CPU-bound; ``async`` does not
make it faster. Mitigations here use :mod:`msgspec` (already a dependency) for
compact JSON bytes and fewer temporary allocations on hot paths. Offloading
serialization to ``asyncio.to_thread`` is reserved for unusually large payloads
where event-loop latency matters; typical SSE chunks are cheaper inline.
